## 1. What is Python?
Python has quickly become a favorite- it’s being taught in universities, and also being used for everything from scripting and web development to machine learning and data science. But what is Python?

Python is a general-purpose programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and dynamically-typed. Guido Van Rossum, its BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life), named it over the British comedy group Monty Python. The implementation we widely use is CPython (written in C). Python has powerful frameworks and libraries. You can install these libraries with pip, and find them in PyPI (Python Package Index).

## 6. Basics of Python for beginners

### a. Python Basic Constructs

Let’s first see what Python looks like.

 - **[Functions](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-function/)** - Collections of statements grouped under a name. May or may not return a value.
 - **[Classes](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-class/) and Objects** - Python is object-oriented. A class is an abstract data type and a blueprint with no values. An object is an instance of a class. Everything in Python is an object.
 - **[Modules](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-modules/)** - Modules are collections of related classes and functions. You can use code from these instead of writing your own for trivial functionality.
 - **[Packages](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-packages/)** - They are collections of related modules. You can also create your own packages.
 - **[Lists](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-lists-examples/)** - These are collections of values in the CSV format. Lists are mutable objects.
 - **[Tuples](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-tuples-syntax-examples/)** - These are like lists, but immutable.
 - **[Dictionaries](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-dictionary/)** - These are collections of key-value pairs defined using curly braces.
 - **[Sets](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-set-and-booleans-with-examples/)** - They can’t have duplicates, and are mutable.
 - **Comments and Docstrings** - Comments are for the developer, explain code and are declared with a hash (#) sign. Docstrings are documentation strings that explain code. There are no multiline comments.

 - .py
 - .pyc
 - .pyd
 - .pyo
 - .pyw
 - .pyz

## 7. Python Syntax

Refer to the links above to learn about variables, operators, and other topics. Here, we will talk about the **[syntax of Python code](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-syntax-semantics/)**.

 - Line Structure - Python Programs consist of logical lines. Each line has a NEWLINE token at the end. Blank lines are ignored.
 - Multiline statements - There are no semicolons or braces in Python (you can use semicolons if you want, but they are not mandatory)
   - Backward slash - To distribute a statement across multiple lines in Python.
   - Triple quotes - Put strings in triple quotes to span them across multiple lines.
 - Comments - They explain code and are ignored by the interpreter. Declared by hash (#).
 - Docstrings - Documentation strings that explain code. Retained at runtime for inspection.
 - Indentation - Since there are no curly braces, you need to indent code blocks equally. You can use tabs or spaces, but not a combination of both. PEP8 recommends using 4 spaces.
 - Multiple statements in one line - You can use semicolons to separate multiple statements in one line. You can also put an if-statement’s single-line body in one line.
 - Quotations - You can delimit strings with single or double quotes, but not both (opening with one and closing with another). If you use single quotes inside the string, use double quotes to delimit. You can escape quotes inside strings with the escape character (\).
 - Identifiers - These are names of elements, and are case-sensitive. You need to follow some rules when naming identifiers.
 - Variables - They hold values. Python follows duck-typing and is dynamically-typed. You don’t need to declare the type of variable, that is determined by the interpreter at runtime.
 - String formatters - For this, you can use the % operator, the format() method, or f-strings.
 - **[Python vs Java vs C++](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-vs-java/)** - Curly braces are mandatory in Java and C++, but Python uses whitespace indentation to delimit code. Semicolons are optional in Python, but can cause errors in C++ and Java. Python is dynamically-typed, Java and C++ are statically-typed. Java is faster than Python.

## 8. Popular IDEs

## 17. Case Studies - Python

### a. Python at Netflix

**[Netflix uses Python](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-at-netflix/)** for data analysis and its backend services. It is how it recommends new titles. Netflix also uses Python to build custom extensions to the Jupyter server. This can be used to manage tasks like logging, archiving, publishing and cloning notebooks. Netflix uses the statistical and numerical libraries like numpy, scipy, tuptures, and pandas. It also uses Python for automation, data exploration, and visualization. It implements demand engineering, insight engineering, Open Connect Network, Information Security, an ML infrastructure, Notebooks, a Partner Ecosystem, and Animation and NVFX.

### b. Spotify
Like Netflix, Spotify uses [Python](https://www.python.org/) for data analysis and backend services. It uses ZeroMQ for backend communication- this is an open networking framework written in Python and C++. Python allows fast development. Also, Spotify uses it for data analytics to create suggestions and recommendations. It also uses Luigi for synchronization with Hadoop. This lets it create "Radio and Discovery".

### c. Quora

Quora is a social networking platform with questions and answers. They considered many languages before choosing Python because it has no type checking, and is slow. They rejected C# because the Microsoft Language is proprietary. Java has strict syntax, so it was rejected. So, like Google, Quora chose Python for its ease of writing and readability. They solved the problem of type checking by writing unit tests. They also liked the frameworks for Python- Django and Pylons. It was also easier to club Python and JS for handling user interactions.

### d. Facebook

Facebook extensively uses Python. The libraries and frameworks reduce the code-load and focus on improvements. Facebook used Python for multiple services in infrastructure management, and made it scale-efficient. It also published Py3 written projects, including Facebook Ads API and a Python async IRC bot framework.

### e. Google

Google has been using Python since the beginning. They decided to implement Python for ease of maintenance and faster delivery than C++. They also recoded some Perl or Bash scripts into Python. Python is the official Google server-side language at Google. Peter Norvig, and American computer scientist, said "Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning and remains so as the system grows and evolves. Today, dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we're looking for more people with skills in this language."
